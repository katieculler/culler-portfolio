# Final Project
## Part 1 
### Outline 
This project will show the economic impact of the performing arts on the U.S. economy from the years 2013-2015. It will compare the different performing arts industries and their growth over those three years in the area of employment, consumption, real value added and real output to the economy. The goal of the project will show the positive impact on the U.S. economy the performing arts have had and be able to be used for advocacy to show to local and federal representatives. 

### Data
I will be using data from the Nation Endowment for Arts (NEA) and the U.S. Arts and Cultural Production Satellite Account (ACPSA).  I will focus on the data from the years 2013-2015 and look at employment, consumption, real-value added and real output data.

### Method and Medium 
To complete the project data visualizations will be made using raw graphs and infogram. The final story will be created in shorthand. To fully realize the visualizations they will first be wireframed and shown to the intended audience to receive feedback. After feedback, changes will be made to make the story clear and consise. This process will happen a few times to make sure it is clear for the intended audience. 

## Part 2 
### Storyboard 



### User Research, Protocol, 
My inteneded audience is arts professionals to use this story for arts advocacy. For my user research I asked 5 students in the Carnegie Mellon Universtiy, Heniz College, Masters of Arts Management program to look at my graphs, so far I only have 3 responses. I sent them a google form with the 3 data visualizations and the same five quetions after every visualization.
