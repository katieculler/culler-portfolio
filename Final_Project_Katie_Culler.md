# Final Project
## Part 1 
### Outline 
This project will show the economic impact of the performing arts on the U.S. economy from the years 2013-2015. It will compare the different performing arts industries and their growth over those three years in the area of employment, consumption, real value added and real output to the economy. The goal of the project will show the positive impact on the U.S. economy the performing arts have had and be able to be used for advocacy to show to local and federal representatives. 

### Data
I will be using data from the Nation Endowment for Arts (NEA) and the U.S. Arts and Cultural Production Satellite Account (ACPSA).  I will focus on the data from the years 2013-2015 and look at employment, consumption, real-value added and real output data.

### Method and Medium 
To complete the project data visualizations will be made using raw graphs and infogram. The final story will be created in shorthand. To fully realize the visualizations they will first be wireframed and shown to the intended audience to receive feedback. After feedback, changes will be made to make the story clear and consise. This process will happen a few times to make sure it is clear for the intended audience.

This is the end result at many attempts at my sketches that came out of the storybaord.

### User Research, Protocol, 
My inteneded audience is people who would want to use this story for arts advocacy. For my user research I asked 5 students in the Carnegie Mellon Universtiy, Heniz College, Masters of Arts Management program to look at my graphs, so far I only have 3 responses. I sent them a google form with the 3 data visualizations and the same five quetions after every visualization.

## Part 3 
As stated above, my intended audience for my final data story is a person who wants to do arts advocacy. They would be passionate enough to talk to a representative about the impace and issues facing the field. They would not necessarily work in the field of arts management, but would have a deep connection and apprecation for the arts. To help people who might not have a professional background in the arts or arts management but still wanting to be persuasive, I decided to use the story of how the arts helped to revitalize downtown Pittsburgh from a red-light district in to a thriving cultural district. I also tried to keep the presentation simple and easy to explain, so the audience would be able to use the presentation themselves to talk about with others. 

### Personas: I made two personas to help understand the story better. 
The first one is Jane. She is 35 years old, has a master's degree and works as a Marketing Director for a Tech Start-Up that sells posture correctors. She loves the arts, especially her local musical theater company, and wants to go to D.C. for Arts Advocacy day to talk to her representative about how much the arts have impacted herself and her community. To learn more about Jane you can see more of her work background [here](https://www.hubspot.com/make-my-persona?persona=-LZbGGSWRURZxy3hJxFF) 

The second persona is Jim. He is a 56 year old ER physician. He still practices clincially in the ER but mostly handles administratvie duties. He is a lover of opera and decides that he wants to become more involved beucase he isn't working clinically as much anymore. He knows there are issues facing the arts and want to talk local community board about the benefits of the arts.

### Design
When working out my design decisions I knew I wanted to keep my graphs, fonts, colors, pictures, etc. very simple and easy to understand. I looked at the story from starting at the very wide view of the overall arts economic impact to a singular persons impact from buying a ticket to a performing arts event. From the feedback I received on my initial graphs I realized if each of the graphs were talking about the same performing arts industry they needed to have the same title and same color used for each industry so it is more clear to the audience. I also realized that I could make the coolest looking graph in the world but if no one outside of myself understood what it was trying to portray it meant nothing. 

My story and what I was trying to tell has evolved since I first wrote part one of this project. I started with the idea of the project showing the economic impact of the performing arts on the U.S. economy from the years 2013-2015. It was going to compare performing arts industries and their growth over those three years in the area of employment, consumption, real value added and real output to the economy. The project is still showing the impact of the performing arts on the economy, but it takes a more funneled look and doesn't focus on a 3 years change and comparison of the performing arts industries.
