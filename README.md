Public Portfolio for Telling Stories with Data Class at CMU 

# About Me 
Hi! My name is Katie Culler and I hail from the great state of Ohio. I am a second year Master of Arts Management Student at Carnegie Mellon University. I have a bachelors degree in vocal performance from The Ohio State University. I came to Carnegie Mellon straight from undergrad. Currently, I am the development intern at the Children's Museum of Pittsburgh. I try and sing as often as I can and I love to cook. 

# What I Hope to Learn 
This class is intimidating to me, but I wanted a challenge. Coming from an arts background, I have very little knowledge about data visualization. I have learned a lot at Heinz about data, but not what comes after finding it and learning to collect it. I hope this course gives me the skills and tools to use that data in an effective way.
